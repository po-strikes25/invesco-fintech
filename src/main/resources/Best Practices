ISSUES FACED:
- LOMBOK ANNOTATIONS FOR GETTERS AND SETTERS DID NOT WORK, TRIED REBUILDING PROJECT MANY TIMES

- USING SPRING SECURITY WITHOUT DISABLING CSRF CAN CAUSE CSRF TOKEN ISSUE -
USUALLY FOR PUT/POST/DELETE TYPE REQUESTS AS THESE CHANGE THE DATA

- CSRF ISSUE WON'T HAPPEN FOR GET, HEAD, OPTIONS TYPE REQUESTS

- BETTER TO ALWAYS DISABLE THE CSRF CONFIGURATION AS APIs ARE TYPICALLY STATELESS

- POSTMAN AND OTHER TOOLS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY HANDLE CSRF TOKENS

- CSRF TOKEN IS DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR NOT A BUG

- USE REQUIRED ARGS CONSTRUCTOR WITH FINAL KEYWORD TO INJECT THE SERVICE AND REPOSITORY
INSTANCES ELSE THE CONSTRUCTOR WON'T BE CALLED

- FACING ERROR IN CASE WHERE TABLE IS CREATED BUT I HAVE REMOVED COLS FROMT EH TABLE SO THERE
IS TABLE COL MISMATCH HENCE WHILE ENTERING THE DATA THERE IS SQL ISSUE: SOLUTION:
Enable Schema Auto-Update with spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
ALS0: Hibernate does not remove unused columns for safety â€” to avoid accidental data loss.

- \du IN POSTGRES TO GET LIST OF ROLES

- psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5433 -d postgres
- user: postgres - password: root
